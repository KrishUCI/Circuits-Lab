# Circuits-Lab
Fall 2017 EECS 170A Lab

Lab 1 - Please look in this directory for the data for lab 1. Data is in Lab1.tex. That's where our final writeup will be. Right now, that's the location of the data. Sample.tex is a little tutorial on LaTeX. I advise reading that first. Please write your sections in a different file, so don't directly edit Lab1.tex. In the end, I'll just include everyone's section and then compile the final product.
