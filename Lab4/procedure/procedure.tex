\underline{Procedure}

The objective of this lab is to observe many different types of diodes using an oscilloscope. A circuit is built with a voltage supply (DC) in series with a resistor, and the resistor in series with multiple different diodes. A voltmeter is attached across a diode to measure the voltage drop over it. Many different voltage measurements over the diode is measured by varying the source voltage. Next, the I-V characteristics of the diodes and the breakdown voltage are measured. Lastly, a phototransistor is used in the circuit, and it is illuminated with light in reverse, zero, and forward bias to make it function as a photodiode. The change in current is then observed. \\
