\underline{Procedure}

For the second Electronics Lab, the objective is to solder RC circuits on a printed circuit board and then test the circuit as a Lowpass and Highpass Filter. To solder the resistor and capacitor, a soldering iron is used by melting metal onto the ends of the resistor and capacitor on a printed circuit board. After soldering, the output voltage in sine wave mode is measured at different frequencies using the oscilloscope. The Lowpass Filter has the capacitor in parallel with the oscilloscope, while the Highpass filter has the resistor in parallel with the oscilloscope. After taking the measurements, the transfer function ($\frac{Output Voltage}{Input Voltage}$) for both filters are plotted as a function of frequency on a log-log scale. Lastly, the impulse response is measured by sending a pulse signal that is shorter than the RC time constant. The measured responses are then compared to the theoretical responses. \\
