For the circuit with the oscilloscope, students will measure the voltage across the oscilloscope from a circuit using resistors of value 1MΩ and 1kΩ simultaneously while setting the frequency to 1kHz. A formula is then derived to relate the measured voltage and the battery voltage (\ref{eq:osc_ratio}), which will then be used to find the impedance of the oscilloscope by hand. The experiment will be repeated using a frequency of 1MHz.
